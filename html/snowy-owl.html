      The snowy owl is one of the largest species of owl, and it is the only owl with mainly white plumage.
      Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime.
      A nomadic bird, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes even migrating to the south in large numbers.
